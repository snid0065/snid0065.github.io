        <h3> About Me </h3>
           <p>My name is Emma Snider. I have been around the sun 18 times, throughout those 18 years I have pursued <em>many</em> hobbies. Mostly crafty things like sewing, crocheting, beading, painting and such; most outstanding though is the years I spent as a competitive horseback rider. I have been riding since I could walk but hung up my helmet before moving to Ottawa to pursue a college degree and career.

        <p> I am super happy to be here pursuing another side of my interests. Since I started high school my electives have been split between technology and arts credits. It was really hard to be a girl in tech classes. I was usually the only in each of those classes, especially my computer science classes. I persevered through and came out on top of every class, even graduating with a 95% average. Here I get to be creative while playing on computers, a dream come true.

        <p> This paragraph is going to be some random stuff about me using all sorts of fun tags! First I don't drink enough H<sup>2</sup>O. Its a known fact, fold to me by <strong> <em>several</em></strong> a health professionals. That sounds bad... a totally normal number of health professionals. I am also a but of an insomniac <mark>(I have been awake for 49 hours and counting)</mark>, so if you recieve emails from me at 3:47am, that might be why. Whats an abbreviation I can throw in here? How about <abbr title="Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus"> SCUBA</abbr>, more fun facts, I am a certified SCUBA diver! I love to dive in Mexico and the Bahamas, but as soon as anyone mentions caves I am <strong>out.</strong>
