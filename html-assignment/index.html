        <h3> About Me </h3>
           <p>My name is Emma Snider. I have been around the sun 18 times, throughout those 18 years I have pursued <em>many</em> hobbies. Mostly crafty things like sewing, crocheting, beading, painting and such; most outstanding though is the years I spent as a competitive horseback rider. I have been riding since I could walk but hung up my helmet before moving to Ottawa to pursue a college degree and career.

        <p> I am super happy to be here pursuing another side of my interests. Since I started high school my electives have been split between technology and arts credits. It was really hard to be a girl in tech classes. I was usually the only in each of those classes, especially my computer science classes. I persevered through and came out on top of every class, even graduating with a 95% average. Here I get to be creative while playing on computers, a dream come true.
