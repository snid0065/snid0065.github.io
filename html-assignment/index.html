        <h1> About Me </h1>
           <p>My name is Emma Snider. I have been around the sun 18 times, throughtout those 18 years I have pursued <em>many </em> hobbies. Mostly crafty things like sewing, crocheting, beading, painting and such; most outstanding though is the years I spent as a competetive horse back rider. I have been riding since I could walk but hung up my helmet before moving to Ottawa to purse a college degree and career.

        <p> I am super happy to be here pursing another side of my interests. Since I started high school my electives have been split between technology and arts credits. It was really hard to be a girl in tech classes. I was usually the only in each of those classes, especially my computer science classes. I perservered though and came out top of every class, even graduating with an 95% average. Here I get to be creative while playing on computers, dream come true.
